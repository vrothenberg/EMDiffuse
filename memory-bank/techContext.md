## Technical Architecture

### Diffusion Models

The core of the EMDiffuse project is the implementation of diffusion models for image enhancement. Diffusion models are a class of generative models that learn to reverse a diffusion process, where noise is gradually added to an image until it becomes pure noise, and then learn to reverse this process to generate images from noise.

#### Forward Diffusion Process

The forward diffusion process gradually adds noise to an image over a series of timesteps:

```
q(x_t | x_{t-1}) = N(x_t; sqrt(1 - β_t) * x_{t-1}, β_t * I)
```

where:
- `x_t` is the image at timestep t
- `β_t` is the noise schedule at timestep t
- `N` denotes a normal distribution

#### Reverse Diffusion Process

The reverse diffusion process learns to predict the noise that was added at each timestep, allowing the model to generate images by starting from pure noise and gradually denoising:

```
p_θ(x_{t-1} | x_t) = N(x_{t-1}; μ_θ(x_t, t), Σ_θ(x_t, t))
```

where:
- `μ_θ` and `Σ_θ` are learned by the neural network

### UNet Architecture

The neural network architecture used in the diffusion models is based on the UNet architecture, which is well-suited for image-to-image translation tasks. The UNet consists of:

1. **Encoder Path**: A series of convolutional blocks that progressively reduce the spatial dimensions while increasing the feature channels.
2. **Bottleneck**: The middle part of the network with the highest feature channel count and lowest spatial dimensions.
3. **Decoder Path**: A series of convolutional blocks that progressively increase the spatial dimensions while decreasing the feature channels.
4. **Skip Connections**: Connections from the encoder path to the decoder path to preserve spatial information.

### 3D UNet Architecture

For the vEMDiffuse models, a 3D UNet architecture is used to handle volumetric data. The 3D UNet is similar to the 2D UNet but uses 3D convolutions and operates on 3D volumes.

### RAFT for Image Registration

The RAFT (Recurrent All Pairs Field Transforms) module is used for image registration and alignment. RAFT is a state-of-the-art optical flow estimation method that is used to align image pairs for training the EMDiffuse models.

## Data Formats and Structures

### Input Data Formats

1. **2D Images**: For EMDiffuse-n and EMDiffuse-r, the input data consists of 2D images in TIFF format.
2. **3D Volumes**: For vEMDiffuse-i and vEMDiffuse-a, the input data consists of 3D volumes represented as a series of 2D slices in TIFF format.

### Data Directory Structure

The data directory structure for training is as follows:

For EMDiffuse-n:
```
data_root/
  ├── cell_1/
  │   ├── noise_level_1/
  │   │   ├── wf_image1.tif  # Noisy image
  │   │   ├── gt_image1.tif  # Clean image
  │   │   └── ...
  │   └── ...
  └── ...
```

For EMDiffuse-r:
```
data_root/
  ├── cell_1/
  │   ├── zoom_level_1/
  │   │   ├── wf_image1.tif  # Low-resolution image
  │   │   ├── gt_image1.tif  # High-resolution image
  │   │   └── ...
  │   └── ...
  └── ...
```

For vEMDiffuse-i and vEMDiffuse-a:
```
vEM_data/
  ├── 0.tif  # First slice
  ├── 1.tif  # Second slice
  ├── ...
  └── n.tif  # Last slice
```

### Model Checkpoints

Model checkpoints are saved in the `experiments` directory with the following structure:

```

  │   └── ...
```

## Technical Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Noise in EM Images

EM images often suffer from noise due to the low electron dose used to prevent sample damage. This results in a low signal-to-noise ratio, making it challenging to extract meaningful information from the images.

**Solution**: EMDiffuse-n uses a diffusion model to learn the mapping from noisy to clean images. The diffusion model is trained on paired noisy and clean images and can effectively remove noise while preserving ultrastructural details.

### Challenge 2: Limited Resolution in EM Images

The resolution of EM images can be limited by various factors, including the microscope's capabilities and sample preparation. This can make it difficult to observe fine details in the images.

**Solution**: EMDiffuse-r uses a diffusion model to enhance the resolution of EM images. The model is trained on paired low-resolution and high-resolution images and can effectively increase the resolution while preserving the image content.

### Challenge 3: Anisotropic Resolution in vEM

In volume electron microscopy (vEM), the resolution along the z-axis (depth) is often much lower than the resolution in the xy-plane. This results in anisotropic volumes that are difficult to analyze.

**Solution**: vEMDiffuse-i and vEMDiffuse-a use diffusion models to generate isotropic resolution data from anisotropic volumes. vEMDiffuse-i requires isotropic training data, while vEMDiffuse-a can work without isotropic training data.

### Challenge 4: Image Registration

For training the EMDiffuse models, it is crucial to have well-aligned image pairs. However, manual alignment is time-consuming and error-prone.

**Solution**: The RAFT module is used for automatic image registration and alignment. RAFT is a state-of-the-art optical flow estimation method that can accurately align image pairs.

### Challenge 5: GPU Memory Constraints

Diffusion models can be memory-intensive, especially for large images or volumes. This can be a limitation when training on GPUs with limited memory.

**Solution**: The implementation includes memory-efficient techniques such as gradient checkpointing and mixed-precision training. Additionally, the models can be trained on smaller patches and applied to larger images or volumes during inference.

## Performance Considerations

### Training Performance

1. **GPU Acceleration**: Training is accelerated using GPUs, which can significantly reduce training time.
2. **Batch Size**: The batch size can be adjusted based on the available GPU memory. Larger batch sizes can lead to faster training but require more memory.
3. **Learning Rate**: The learning rate can be adjusted to balance training speed and stability.
4. **Gradient Checkpointing**: Gradient checkpointing can be used to reduce memory usage at the cost of increased computation time.
5. **Mixed Precision Training**: Mixed precision training can be used to reduce memory usage and increase training speed on compatible GPUs.

### Inference Performance

1. **GPU Acceleration**: Inference is also accelerated using GPUs, which can significantly reduce inference time.
2. **Batch Size**: The batch size can be adjusted based on the available GPU memory. Larger batch sizes can lead to faster inference but require more memory.
3. **Number of Diffusion Steps**: The number of diffusion steps can be adjusted to balance inference speed and quality. More steps generally lead to higher quality but slower inference.
4. **JIT Compilation**: JIT-compiled versions of the UNet architectures are available for faster inference.
