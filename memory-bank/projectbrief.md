# EMDiffuse Project Brief

## Project Overview

EMDiffuse is a diffusion-based deep learning method for enhancing electron microscopy (EM) images. It is designed to improve the quality of ultrastructural imaging in EM and extend the capabilities of volume electron microscopy (vEM). The project implements several variants of diffusion models tailored for specific EM applications:

1. **EMDiffuse-n**: For EM denoising, removing noise from EM images to reveal clearer ultrastructural details.
2. **EMDiffuse-r**: For EM super-resolution, enhancing the resolution of EM images to reveal finer details.
3. **vEMDiffuse-i**: For generating isotropic resolution data from anisotropic volumes in vEM, using isotropic training data.
4. **vEMDiffuse-a**: For generating isotropic resolution data from anisotropic volumes in vEM, without requiring isotropic training data.
