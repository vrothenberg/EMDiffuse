# EMDiffuse Active Context

## Current Project Status

The EMDiffuse project is a completed research project that has been published in Nature Communications. The codebase is now being maintained and updated based on user feedback and new research developments. The project has successfully implemented diffusion models for electron microscopy image enhancement, including denoising, super-resolution, and isotropic reconstruction.

## Recent Changes

1. **Documentation Improvements**: We have added comprehensive documentation to the codebase to make it more accessible to users. This includes:
   - README files for each module explaining its purpose and functionality.
   - Example notebooks demonstrating how to use the models for various tasks.
   - Memory bank files documenting the project's context, architecture, and technical details.

2. **Code Organization**: We have organized the code into a modular structure that separates concerns and promotes code reuse. This includes:
   - Core module with base classes and utilities.
   - Models module with diffusion model implementations.
   - Data module with dataset implementations.
   - Config module with configuration files for different model variants.
   - RAFT module for image registration and alignment.
   - 3D-SR-Unet module as an alternative approach to vEMDiffuse.

3. **Example Notebooks**: We have added example notebooks demonstrating how to use the models for various tasks:
   - 2D EM denoising with EMDiffuse-n.
   - 2D EM super-resolution with EMDiffuse-r.
   - Isotropic vEM reconstruction with vEMDiffuse-i.
   - Isotropic vEM reconstruction with vEMDiffuse-a.

## Active Decisions
