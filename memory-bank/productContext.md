# EMDiffuse Product Context

## Problem Statement

Electron microscopy (EM) is a powerful imaging technique that allows researchers to visualize ultrastructural details of biological samples at nanometer resolution. However, EM images often suffer from several limitations:

1. **Noise**: EM images can be noisy due to the low electron dose used to prevent sample damage, resulting in a low signal-to-noise ratio.
2. **Limited Resolution**: The resolution of EM images can be limited by various factors, including the microscope's capabilities and sample preparation.
3. **Anisotropic Resolution**: In volume electron microscopy (vEM), the resolution along the z-axis (depth) is often much lower than the resolution in the xy-plane, resulting in anisotropic volumes that are difficult to analyze.

These limitations can hinder the analysis and interpretation of EM data, making it challenging to extract meaningful biological insights.

## Solution Overview

EMDiffuse addresses these limitations by applying diffusion models to enhance EM images. The project offers four main variants:

1. **EMDiffuse-n**: For EM denoising, removing noise from EM images while preserving ultrastructural details.
2. **EMDiffuse-r**: For EM super-resolution, enhancing the resolution of EM images to reveal finer details.
3. **vEMDiffuse-i**: For generating isotropic resolution data from anisotropic volumes in vEM, using isotropic training data.
4. **vEMDiffuse-a**: For generating isotropic resolution data from anisotropic volumes in vEM, without requiring isotropic training data.

These models are trained on paired data (noisy/clean, low-res/high-res, anisotropic/isotropic) and can be applied to new data to enhance image quality and enable more accurate analysis.

## User Experience

### Workflow

1. **Data Preparation**: Users prepare their data according to the requirements of the specific model they want to use.
   - For EMDiffuse-n: Paired noisy and clean images.
   - For EMDiffuse-r: Paired low-resolution and high-resolution images.
   - For vEMDiffuse-i: Isotropic volume data.
   - For vEMDiffuse-a: Anisotropic volume data.

2. **Training**: Users train the model on their prepared data using the provided training scripts.
   - Configure the model using JSON configuration files.
   - Train the model using the `run.py` script with appropriate arguments.
   - Monitor training progress using TensorBoard.

3. **Inference**: Users apply the trained model to new data using the provided inference scripts.
   - Prepare the input data according to the model's requirements.
   - Run inference using the `run.py` script with appropriate arguments.
   - Visualize and save the results.

### User Interface
